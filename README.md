In this tutorial you will learn how to create Machine Learning Linear Regression Model. You will be analyzing a house price predication dataset for finding out price of house on different parameters. You will do Exploratory Data Analysis, split the training and testing data, Model Evaluation and Predictions.

Problem Statement:
A real state agents want the help to predict the house price for regions. He gave you the dataset to work on and you decided to use Linear Regressioon Model. Create a model which will help him to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

Dataset contains 81 columns and 1460 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :

'Id' : Unique number to filter houses according to our requirements
'BedroomAbvGr' : no. of bedroom
'FullBath' : no. of bathroom
'GrLivArea' : squre foot area of house
'Salesprice' : Selling price of house
'LotArea' : Area of the property
'SaleCondition' : Condition of house
